# Installing text mod

1. [Click this link to download the file](https://gist.github.com/xPaw/056b29be7ae9c143ed623a9c4c10cf50/raw/csgo_textmod.txt) (<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>)
2. Name this file `csgo_textmod.txt` and put it inside this folder: `Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\resource`
   - **Notice the `game\csgo` (CS2) folder, and not just `csgo` (CS:GO).**
4. Add `-language textmod` to your launch options

### Not working? Make sure that:
- `csgo_textmod.txt` is placed in the right folder (it needs to be inside the CS2 `game\csgo\resource` folder)
- Launch option is spelled correctly, this is an example that will work: `-novid -language textmod`

This was based on bananagaming text mod, but I have been modifying it over the years for CS:GO.
