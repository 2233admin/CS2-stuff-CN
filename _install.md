# Installing text mod

1. Move `csgo_bananagaming.txt` inside this folder: `Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource`
2. Add `-language bananagaming` to your launch options

### Not working? Make sure that:
- `csgo_bananagaming.txt` is placed in the right folder (it needs to be inside the resource folder)
- Launch options is spelled correctly, this is an example that will work: `-novid -language bananagaming -tickrate 128`

# Installing radio mod
1. Replace `radiopanel.txt` in  `Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource\ui` folder
2. Set correct binds: `bind z radio1; bind x radio2; bind c radio3; bind v radio`
