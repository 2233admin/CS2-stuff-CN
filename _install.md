# Installing text mod

1. Click `Raw` to download the file
2. Move `csgo_textmod.txt` inside this folder: `Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\resource`
3. Add `-language textmod` to your launch options

### Not working? Make sure that:
- `csgo_textmod.txt` is placed in the right folder (it needs to be inside the resource folder)
- Launch options is spelled correctly, this is an example that will work: `-novid -language textmod`

ignore this:
